# CheckInSystem

Java prototype for a biometric-style check-in and check-out attendance system.

## Overview

This project simulates a biometric attendance system where users can check in and check out using their **userID**. It's a prototype that demonstrates the core functionality of attendance logging using Java arrays and HashMaps.

The system is designed for learning and prototyping purposes and can later be expanded with real biometric hardware or a database.
